* Bugfix: Clicking on a migrated dataset would result in sending PDS contents in the form of the dataset contents, rather than displaying the PDS as a folder of PDS members. Now, clicking on a migrated dataset will either display its contents or show PDS members, depending on whether or not the dataset is or is not a PDS.
* Security: Update dependencies to more recent minor versions to reduce quantity of npm audit warnings.
